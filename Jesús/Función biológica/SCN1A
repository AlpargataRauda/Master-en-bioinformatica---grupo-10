Pore-forming subunit of Nav1.1, a voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel that directly mediates the depolarizing phase of action potentials in excitable membranes. Navs, also called VGSCs (voltage-gated sodium channels) or VDSCs (voltage-dependent sodium channels), operate by switching between closed and open conformations depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. In the open conformation they allow Na+ ions to selectively pass through the pore, along their electrochemical gradient. The influx of Na+ ions provokes membrane depolarization, initiating the propagation of electrical signals throughout cells and tissues.
By regulating the excitability of neurons, ensures that they respond appropriately to synaptic inputs, maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in brain neural circuits.
Nav1.1 plays a role in controlling the excitability and action potential propagation from somatosensory neurons, thereby contributing to the sensory perception of mechanically-induced pain.
